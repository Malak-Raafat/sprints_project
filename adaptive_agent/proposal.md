## Proposal:
**Title:** Investigating the Interplay between Symbolic and Subsymbolic Representations in Fairness-Aware Intersymbolic Systems

**Introduction:**
The increasing complexity of artificial intelligence (AI) systems has raised concerns about fairness, transparency, and accountability. Recent advances in AI research have highlighted the importance of understanding the interplay between symbolic and subsymbolic representations in achieving fairness in AI systems. This proposal outlines a research project that aims to investigate the role of symbolic, subsymbolic, and intersymbolic representations in fairness-aware system design.

**Research Objectives:**

1. **Symbolic Representations:** Develop a framework for analyzing and evaluating the fairness of symbolic representations in AI systems, focusing on their impact on decision-making processes.
2. **Subsymbolic Representations:** Investigate the role of subsymbolic representations (e.g., neural networks) in fairness-aware system design, exploring their potential to mitigate biases and improve fairness.
3. **Intersymbolic Systems:** Design and evaluate intersymbolic systems that integrate symbolic and subsymbolic representations to achieve fairness, transparency, and accountability in AI decision-making.
4. **Fairness Evaluation:** Develop a comprehensive framework for evaluating fairness in AI systems, incorporating metrics and methodologies that account for symbolic, subsymbolic, and intersymbolic representations.

**Methodology:**

1. **Literature Review:** Conduct a thorough review of existing research on symbolic, subsymbolic, and intersymbolic representations in AI systems, with a focus on fairness and transparency.
2. **System Design:** Design and implement fairness-aware AI systems that integrate symbolic, subsymbolic, and intersymbolic representations, using case studies from domains such as healthcare, finance, and education.
3. **Experiments and Evaluation:** Conduct experiments to evaluate the fairness, transparency, and accountability of the designed systems, using the developed framework and metrics.
4. **Case Studies:** Apply the proposed framework to real-world case studies, demonstrating the effectiveness of the approach in achieving fairness and transparency in AI systems.

**Expected Outcomes:**

1. **Fairness-Aware System Design:** Develop a fairness-aware system design framework that integrates symbolic, subsymbolic, and intersymbolic representations.
2. **Comprehensive Fairness Evaluation:** Establish a comprehensive framework for evaluating fairness in AI systems, accounting for symbolic, subsymbolic, and intersymbolic representations.
3. **Improved Transparency and Accountability:** Demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach in improving transparency and accountability in AI decision-making processes.

**Impact:**
This research project has the potential to contribute significantly to the development of fairness-aware AI systems, with implications for various domains, including healthcare, finance, education, and social justice. The proposed framework and evaluation metrics will provide a foundation for designing and evaluating fairness-aware AI systems, promoting transparency, accountability, and trust in AI decision-making processes.

**Timeline:**
The proposed research project will be completed within 24 months, with the following milestones:

* Months 1-6: Literature review, system design, and framework development
* Months 7-12: Experiments, evaluation, and case studies
* Months 13-18: Analysis, writing, and revisions
* Months 19-24: Finalize and disseminate the research findings

**Personnel:**
The research team will consist of a principal investigator, a postdoctoral researcher, and a graduate student, with expertise in AI, machine learning, and fairness-aware system design.

**Resources:**
The project will require access to computational resources, including high-performance computing clusters, and software licenses for AI and machine learning frameworks. Additionally, the team will require funding for travel, conferences, and workshops to disseminate the research findings.
